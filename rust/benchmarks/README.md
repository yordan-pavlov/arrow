# Apache Arrow Rust Benchmarks

This crate contains benchmarks based on popular public data sets and open source benchmark suites, making it easy to
run real-world benchmarks to help with performance and scalability testing and for comparing performance with other Arrow
implementations as well as other query engines.

Currently, only DataFusion benchmarks exist, but the plan is to add benchmarks for the arrow, flight, and parquet 
crates as well. 

## Benchmark derived from TPC-H

These benchmarks are derived from the [TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/) benchmark. Data for this benchmark can be 
generated using [tpch-dbgen](https://github.com/databricks/tpch-dbgen).

```bash
cargo run --release --bin tpch -- --iterations 3 --path /mnt/tpch/csv --format csv --query 1 --batch-size 4096
```

## NYC Taxi Benchmark

These benchmarks are based on the [New York Taxi and Limousine Commission](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) data set.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin nyctaxi -- --iterations 3 --path /mnt/nyctaxi/csv --format csv --batch-size 4096
```

Example output:

```bash
Running benchmarks with the following options: Opt { debug: false, iterations: 3, batch_size: 4096, path: "/mnt/nyctaxi/csv", file_format: "csv" }
Executing 'fare_amt_by_passenger'
Query 'fare_amt_by_passenger' iteration 0 took 7138 ms
Query 'fare_amt_by_passenger' iteration 1 took 7599 ms
Query 'fare_amt_by_passenger' iteration 2 took 7969 ms
