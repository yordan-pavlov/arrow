//! DataFusion is an extensible query execution framework that uses
//! Apache Arrow as the memory model.
//!
//! DataFusion supports both SQL and a DataFrame API for building logical query plans
//! and also provides a query optimizer and execution engine capable of parallel execution
//! against partitioned data sources (CSV and Parquet) using threads.
//!
//! DataFusion currently supports simple projection, filter, and aggregate queries.
//!
/// [ExecutionContext](../execution/context/struct.ExecutionContext.html) is the main interface
/// for executing queries with DataFusion.
///
/// The following example demonstrates how to use the context to execute a query against a CSV
/// data source using the DataFrame API:
///
/// ```
/// # use datafusion::prelude::*;
/// # use datafusion::error::Result;
/// # fn main() -> Result<()> {
/// let mut ctx = ExecutionContext::new();
/// let df = ctx.read_csv("tests/example.csv", CsvReadOptions::new())?;
/// let df = df.filter(col("a").lt_eq(col("b")))?
///            .aggregate(vec![col("a")], vec![min(col("b"))])?
///            .limit(100)?;
/// let results = df.collect();
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The following example demonstrates how to execute the same query using SQL:
///
/// ```
/// use datafusion::prelude::*;
///
/// let mut ctx = ExecutionContext::new();
/// ctx.register_csv("example", "tests/example.csv", CsvReadOptions::new()).unwrap();
/// let results = ctx.sql("SELECT a, MIN(b) FROM example GROUP BY a LIMIT 100").unwrap();
/// ```
